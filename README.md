[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/augcampos/xls?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/augcampos/xls)

A pure Go library for reading Microsoft Excel `.xls` (BIFF8) files.

This is a maintained and modernized fork of the original library by [Rongshu Tech (Chinese)](http://www.rongshu.tech), based on [libxls](https://github.com/libxls/libxls).  
Special thanks to original contributors including [@tgulacsi](https://github.com/tgulacsi) and [@flyin9](https://github.com/flyin9).

## üì¶ Basic Usage

```go
import "github.com/augcampos/xls"

// Open from file (auto-closes on error)
wb, err := xls.Open("example.xls")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}

// Open from file with manual control over closing
wb, closer, err := xls.OpenWithCloser("example.xls")
if err != nil {
	log.Fatal(err)
}
defer closer.Close()

// Open from an io.Reader (fully buffered into memory)
f, _ := os.Open("example.xls")
defer f.Close()
wb, err := xls.OpenStream(f)
```
